projectTalon
============

Project Talon is a location-based alarm clock system that uses geolocation to alert one through stops and proximity. Please be advised that currently, Project Talon requires one's permission to let it know where you are exactly. The data will be saved via local storage, yet in later iterations, the app will use an API to keep location, contact information, music, and your experiences with the app, inorder to improve your experience as well as the app's performance. Thanks for trying this out.
